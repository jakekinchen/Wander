![wander-mockups](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3a138db-67d0-4820-b83d-344de06efc37)


## Overview

**Wander** is an iOS app designed to provide users with historical and contextual information about their surroundings. It offers an immersive tour guide experience by tracking the user’s location and movement direction, delivering audio feedback about nearby points of interest (POIs) and buildings using the Realtime API. Wander is designed to get you off your phone and into your environment—the only app designed to not be opened.

Welcome to Wander, where you can hear the context of the world around you without distracting you from that same world.

In an era so chock-full of screens and media capturing your attention, Wander seeks to disrupt this paradigm by introducing Vocal Interfaces, ie software driven purely by interactions with the user's voice. 

## Features

- **Location Tracking:** Continuously monitors your location and movement direction to provide relevant information.
- **Realtime Audio Feedback:** Delivers audio descriptions of nearby POIs and buildings through the Realtime API.
- **Contextual Information:** Offers information specificity that ranges from specific to general when searching for notable mentions.
- **Content Filters:** Allows users to filter content based on historical, commercial, and activity-based categories. The default setting includes all categories.
- **Voice Mode Activation:** Activate Wander’s voice mode by clicking **Activate Wander** in the Map View. Information provided in text form is also stored in the TourView.
- **Immersive Experience:** Designed to enhance your exploration without the need to constantly interact with your phone.

## How It Works

1. **Activate Wander:**
   - Open the app and navigate to the Map View.
   - Click on **Activate Wander** to enable voice mode.
   
2. **Explore Your Surroundings:**
   - As you move, Wander tracks your location and direction.
   - The app uses the Realtime API to fetch and deliver audio feedback about nearby POIs and buildings.
   
3. **Filter Content:**
   - Use content filters to customize the types of information you receive.
   - Choose from historical, commercial, and activity-based filters, or keep the default setting to receive all types of information.
